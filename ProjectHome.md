python-automata is a well-documented Python library for working with DFAs, including the following features:

# Basics #
  * simulate DFA execution input-by-input or over an iterable sequence
  * validate a DFA's definition
  * delta is a function, not a transition table
  * check if the DFA's language is finite

# Unary operations #
  * negation
  * classical minimization
  * DFCA minimization

# Binary operations #
  * generalized cross-product construction, including DFA union, intersection, and symmetric difference

# Constructing automata #
  * Make a randomly connected automaton of any size
  * Make an automaton recognizing a given list of words

# And more... #
